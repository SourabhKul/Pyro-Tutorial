Intro to Probabilistic Programming: Bayesian Data Analysis with Bayesian Regression

by Sourabh Kulkarni (https://www.github.com/SourabhKul)

Following instructions from MLTrain@UAI 2018 Pyro Workshop (http://pyro.ai/examples/bayesian_regression.html)

Some basics before we get started:

Problem under consideration:
Analyzing effect of terrain ruggedness on GDP of african nations, adapted 
from Nunn, N. & Puga, D., Ruggedness: The blessing of bad geography in Africa‚Äù,
Review of Economics and Statistics 94(1), Feb. 2012
- Typically, terrain ruggedness is negetively correlated to GDP of a country
- In Africa, due to it's negetive effect on slavery, it may have a positive
  correlation to country's GDP
- In this code, we test this hypothesis using Bayesian Regression analysis  

To perform Bayesian Regression:
- we define the regression model in a stochastic function
- we declare the parameters to be learnt as being random variables with some prior
- we perform both SVI and MCMC for learning these parameters
- we discuss the tradeoffs involved among the two, and some nuances 

Let's get started!
