Intro to Probabilistic Programming: Models and Inference in Pyro

by Sourabh Kulkarni (https://www.github.com/SourabhKul)

Following instructions from MLTrain@UAI 2018

Why Probabilistic Programming? Powerful generative models:
- Character Generation 
- Scene Representation
- Physics Engines: Simulating real worlds
- Automated Statistician: Perform statistical analysis automatically

Principles of Probabilistic Inference:
- Sum Rule: P(x) = sum_y(P(x,y))
- Product Rule = P(x,y) = P(x)p(y|x)
- Bayes Rule = P(theta|data) = P(data|theta)P(theta)/P(data)

Probabilistic Programming Languages:
- Uniform, Universal specification of processes with high-level abstractions

Recipe:
- High-level Programming Language (Python)
- Primitives of random objects as probability distributions ()
